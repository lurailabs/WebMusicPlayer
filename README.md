# WebMusicPlayer

A browser based music player. Drag and drop your music files to add them to the playlist. 
Nothing will travel to the server, everything happens in your browser. 
Track info and cover image is fetched from the audio file ID3 tags, when present. 
Click on the animation to change it.


TO DO
This webapp is still work in process. Some plans for the future: better animations, improved playlist management (drag&drop), 
integration with SoundCloud tracks and other services, save playlist locally and load it next time.
